NAME
     news -- print news items

SYNOPSIS
     news [-ans] [items]

DESCRIPTION
     The news utility prints news items stored in /var/news.  When invoked
     without any arguments, news prints the name and timestamp of each current
     item followed by its contents, most recent first.	An item is considered
     ``current'' if it has a modification time newer than the file
     ~/.news_time, a file that news creates if it does not exist.  If that
     file does exist, news will update the timestamp on that file each time it
     is run.

     Any items passed to news are interpreted as filenames (either relative to
     /var/news or absolute) to display.

     The following options are available:

     -a		 All available items are displayed, regardless of their ``cur-
		 rency''.

     -n		 Only the names and modification times of the current items
		 are displayed.	 Overrides -s.

     -s		 Report only how many news items are current.  Overrides -n.
		 The timestamp of ~/.news_time is not updated if -s is speci-
		 fied.

AUTHORS
     The news utility was written by Jan Schaumann <jschauma@NetBSD.org> fol-
     lowing the manual page from an IRIX system.

ENVIRONMENT
     The news utility uses the HOME environment variable.
